# Colors

## Note: Colors are not included in CSS output unless used

This is a feature of Tailwind, not a bug. Only the classnames explicitly used (findable in static code) are included in the generated CSS to cut file size.

### Good Example 👍

```tsx
<div className={"text-red-500"} />
```

### Bad Example (`text-red-500` will not appear in generated CSS) 👎
```tsx
<div className={`text-${"red"}-500`} />
````

Thus, you should ensure that you include the full classname if you want the appropriate styles to be included in your final bundle!


## All Colors

All of the available colors and their respective TailwindCSS classnames are listed below:

<Canvas of={ColorsStories.AllColors}/>
