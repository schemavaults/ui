# @schemavaults/ui Storybook.js Site

Welcome! This site allows previewing some of the various React.js user interface components available in the `@schemavaults/ui` package!

## Installation & Setup

[See the documentation on installing and setting up `@schemavaults/ui` + `@schemavaults/theme` for usage in your app.](?path=/docs/installation--docs)

## Source Code

Find the code for the package and this Storybook.js site here: [@schemavaults/ui GitHub Repository](https://github.com/schemavaults/ui).

## Dependencies / Attribution

Most of the styling is built on [TailwindCSS v3](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/). Use the [@schemavaults/theme](https://github.com/schemavaults/theme) package to generate a TailwindCSS config which correctly displays the components from this package.

Many of the components come from [ui.shadcn.com](https://ui.shadcn.com), which in turn uses [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/).

[Framer motion](https://motion.dev/) is used for much of the animation functionality, in addition to [tailwindcss-animate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss-animate).

## @schemavaults/theme

The [@schemavaults/theme](https://github.com/schemavaults/theme) package should be used to generate a TailwindCSS config in your application that consumes these components.
